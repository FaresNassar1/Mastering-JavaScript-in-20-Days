## Data Fetching & Promises

`fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breed/hound/list")
//==>PromiseÂ {<pending>}`
It takes time to fetch data from the network  

### **Promises**

**Promises can be in 3 possible states:**

1. pending: still waiting for the value, hang tight
2. fulfilled (aka "resolved"): finally got the value, all done
3. rejected: sorry couldn't get the value, all done
It takes time for Promises to resolve, so they are "asynchronous"

### **await**
**await** lets us tell JS to stop and wait for an asynchronous operation to finish

`let response = await fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breed/hound/list");
console.log(response);`

In the case of a Promise, it waits for it to resolve before continuing with our code

* Calling the .json() method on the response parses its body as a JSON object
` let body = await response.json()`

--- 
## Destructuring

* Destructuring is a fancy way of declaring multiple variables at once
`let {name, nickname} = spices[0];`
`let {nickname} = spices[2];`
`const [baby, ginger, scary, sporty, posh] = spices;`
`const [,,melB] = spices;`

**We can use ... to collect remaining values**
`const [babySpice, ...adultSpices] = spices;`

## Async functions

```javascript
async function fetchResponse(url) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    return response;
}
```
**This tells JS to expect to await async operations inside the function**

---
## Modules
* Modules let us split big codebases across multiple files

`<script type="module">
    //...
</script>`

- [x] **import && export**
 `// myModule.js
const veryUsefulFunction = () => "I came from a module";
export { veryUsefulFunction };`
### Debugging

* console.log() (or .warn() or .error()) is one way to understand what's happening when your program runs

```javascript
function whyIsntThisWorking(input) {
    console.log("Well at least we got this far");
    console.log(input);
    return thingThatDoesntWork(input);}
```


* You can also use the browser's debugger to pause JS and inspect what's happening
JAVA
