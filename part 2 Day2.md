## Closures

- Closure is the most esoteric of JavaScript concepts
- Enables powerful pro-level functions like ‘once’ and ‘memoize’
- Many JavaScript design patterns including the module pattern use closure
- Build iterators, handle partial application and maintain state in an
asynchronous world
